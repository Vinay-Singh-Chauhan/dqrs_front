By accessing or using our website, applications, products, or services (collectively referred to as "Services"), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<br/>
<p>
<u>Data Collection and Use:</u><br/>
We may collect various types of information from you when you interact with our Services, including but not limited to:
<br/>
a. Personal Information: Information that can be used to identify you personally, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and any other information you provide voluntarily.
<br/>

<p>
We use the collected data to improve and personalize our Services, respond to your inquiries, process transactions, and to communicate with you about our products and promotions. We will not use your personal information for any purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy without obtaining your explicit consent.

<u>Data Security:</u><br/>
We take the security of your data seriously and employ reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Despite our efforts to protect your data, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant the security of any information you provide to us, and you do so at your own risk.
<p><br/>
<u>Data Breach Disclaimer:</u><br/>
While we make every effort to maintain the security of your data, it is essential to understand that no system is entirely immune to security breaches. In the unfortunate event of a data breach, we will promptly take reasonable steps to investigate and mitigate the impact of such an incident. However, we expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for any unauthorized access to your data or information that may occur.

Our Services are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or equivalent minimum age as per applicable laws).
